#### Course Description

This course is part of the Data-Driven Investments curriculum designed to equip students with an
analytical quantitative investment toolkit. Students will work in groups to develop, test, and implement
investment strategies using Python. The investment strategies will be driven by a range of datasets
provided by the instructors. The instructors will provide examples of Python programs implementing
investment strategies.

Each group will first select a primary dataset or set of datasets to utilize. In the first part of the course,
students will explore the data and develop trading ideas. The instructors will provide guidance on what
types of strategies are typically employed using a given dataset.

In the second part of the course, students will implement their chosen strategy using a paper trading
simulation. The course will emphasize understanding the sources of investment performance. This will
include analyses of factor and sector exposures as well as attribution analysis. Student groups will report
weekly on performance evaluation and strategy implementation. The course culminates in a
comprehensive group presentation of the strategy design, implementation, and performance evaluation.

#### Data and Potential Investment Strategies

1. Financial ratios
2. Past price signals (momentum/reversals)
3. Analyst recommendation revisions
4. Corporate insider trades
5. Short interest
6. Corporate events (buybacks, splits, spin-offs)

To request an exception, email either instructor.\n\n\n\n\nThis course is part of the Data-Driven Investments curriculum designed to equip students with an analytical quantitative investment toolkit. Students will work in groups to develop, test, and implement investment strategies using Python. The investment strategies will be driven by a range of datasets provided by the instructors. The instructors will provide examples of Python programs implementing investment strategies.\nEach group will first select a primary dataset or set of datasets to utilize. In the first part of the course, students will explore the data and develop trading ideas. The instructors will provide guidance on what types of strategies are typically employed using a given dataset.\nIn the second part of the course, students will implement their chosen strategy using a paper trading simulation. The course will emphasize understanding the sources of investment performance. This will include analyses of factor and sector exposures as well as attribution analysis. Student groups will report weekly on performance evaluation and strategy implementation. The course culminates in a comprehensive group presentation of the strategy design, implementation, and performance evaluation.\n\n\n\n\nFinancial ratios\nPast price signals (momentum/reversals)\nAnalyst recommendation revisions\nCorporate insider trades\nShort interest\nCorporate events (buybacks, splits, spin-offs)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek\nLab Activities & Notes\n\n\n\n\nJan 8/10\nOnly undergraduates this weekCharacteristics-based strategiesBacktestingAlphas\n\n\nJan 15/17\nNo class on Monday (MLK holiday)Intro to datasets and strategiesForm groups\n\n\nJan 22/24\nIntro to Alpaca paper tradingMachine learning for characteristics-based strategies\n\n\nJan 29/31Feb 5/7\nGroups explore datasets and develop potential investment ideas\n\n\nThursday, Feb 8\nNo class - We will not use the allotted make-up day\n\n\nFeb 12/14\nGroups finalize strategies for paper tradingReport on backtesting on Wednesday\n\n\nRemainder of semester\nConduct paper tradingRefine strategiesReport weekly performance evaluation on Wednesdays\n\n\nFeb 19/21\n\n\n\nFeb 26/28\nOnly undergraduates on Wednesday\n\n\nMar 4/6\nOnly undergraduates this week\n\n\nMar 11/13\nOnly MBAs this week\n\n\nMar 18/20\n\n\n\nMar 25/27\n\n\n\nApr 1/3\n\n\n\nApr 8/10\n\n\n\nApr 15/17\nPresentation: strategy design, performance evaluation, and implementation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrades will be determined using the following weighting scheme.\n\n\n\nAssessment\nWeights\nGroup or Individual?\n\n\n\n\nInitial Strategy Presentation\n20%\nGroup\n\n\nWeekly Performance and Trading Reports\n50%\nGroup\n\n\nFinal Presentation\n20%\nGroup\n\n\nPeer Reviews\n10%\nIndividual"

## Insider Trading

- A large academic and practitioner literature shows that some trades by company insiders contain information about future returns.

- Quandl's Core US Insiders Data (SHARADAR/SF2) can be used to explore these strategies

## Cohen, Malloy, Pomorski (JF 2012)

- Separate routine from opportunistic insider trades

- Routine traders are those trading in same month each year for 3 years

- Opportunistic insider trades have more information content (esp. nonexecutive insiders from geographically concentrated, poorly governed firms)

- A value-weighted portfolio focusing on opportunistic trades returns 82 bps per month

## Akbas, Jiang, and Koch (JF 2020)

- Short-horizon (SH) insiders make both more unexpected and more informed trades than those of long-horizon (LH) insiders.

- Investment horizon: absolute value of average annual net order flow in insider's own-company stock over past 10 years
  - close to 0: insider sometimes buys and sometimes sells
  - close to 1: insider is usually buying or selling (not both)

## Akbas, Jiang, and Koch (JF 2020)

- Long-short strategy of recent strong purchases and sales of **SH** insiders: **2.08%** abnormal monthly return

- Long-short strategy of recent strong purchases and sales of **LH** insiders: **0.77%** per month

## CMP vs AJK

- CMP focuses on unexpectedness in trade *timing*

- AJK focuses on unexpectedness in trade *direction*

- AJK also takes trading strength into account

- Trading strength = net insider purchases scaled by trading volume
  - then take scaled rank in the cross-section of insiders
